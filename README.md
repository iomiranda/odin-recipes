# odin-recipes
Before the project: This project will test what I have learned so far with the course. This will be a basic recipe website. But I think it will definitely test my knowledge so far.

After the project: 
For the most part I was able to remember and utilize the html tags that I learned in this lesson. I remembered the basic syntax of an html file. Using head and body and filling in the contents as needed. I needed to look back at how to insert images. I will need to revice this project to make it look nicer. I'll return once I learn the CSS part of the course.
